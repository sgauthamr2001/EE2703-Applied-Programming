# EE2703 Applied Programming Lab 
Repository holds various problems implemented in Python3 as a part of lab-work for the course EE2703. 

The contents of each week are as follows : 
- week -  1: Tokenising spice netlist file and check if it is valid. 
- week -  2: Basic spice simulator for AC, DC analysis of RLC circuits. 
- week -  3: Least squares fitting of Bessel Function with Gaussian Noise. 
- week -  4: Fourier approximations of functions. 
- week -  5: Solving Laplace equation to get potential of a resistor. 
- week -  6: Simulation of a 1D - Tubelight. 
- week -  7: Applications of Laplace Transform. 
- week -  8: Analog low-pass and high-pass filters.
- week -  9: Using DFT for spectra of periodic signals.  
- week - 10: Using DFT for spectra of non-periodic signals. 

The topic for final assesment is 'Radiation pattern of a Loop Antenna'.
